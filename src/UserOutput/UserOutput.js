      The Buffalo Bills' second-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft recorded his
      first collegiate sack against then-Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen in the
      second quarter of the Hawkeyes' 24-3 win in 2017. By NFL standards,
      it was more of a tackle for a loss -- Epenesa got to Allen shortly after
      the quarterback faked a handoff on a read option.
      Either way, the newest Buffalo Bill had to work for it.
